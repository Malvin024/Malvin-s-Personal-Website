              <p>My rating: 10/10</p>
              <p>Genre: Mystery, Horror, Thriller, Action, Psychological</p>
              <p>Mirai nikki is probably my number one show out of all. This show is a very tense survival game based anime. This show is brilliant, because there are lots of twists and unexpected story going on! You don't even need that much time to complete the show. You can finish it in approximately 3 days? No matter what, give this show some love! Some of you may find it very disturbing, but It's really perfect for dystopian lovers!</p>

              <p>Genre: Psychological, School</p>
              <p>Even though it's not like the Light Novel, I really did like it a lot. It's basically about students of an elite school compete so that they can be the "A" class. It's really captivating and I highly recommend watching the anime first than the light novel (so that you're not gonne be dissapointed). But overall, I really enjoy it a lot! It's gonna blow your mind, hence it shows how human acts in certain situation!</p>

              <p>Genre: Comedy, Parody, Adventure, Fantasy, Supernatural</p>
              <p>There are many comedy based Anime out there. But only a few of them actually make me laugh so hard that I can't barely breathe (literally). But this show is a top tier comedy series. I'm sure most of you can probably relate to me if you watch this. The characters are very fun to watch because it's as if they are in a dialog in their adventures. Don't forget that Megumin is gonna be there! </p>

              <p>Genre: Adventure, Action, Fantasy, Mystery</p>
              <p>This is probably the best adventure based anime I've ever watched. The characters are well told and structured by the delivery. It really makes you want to have it on another season! It's been years though, and the second season is not yet to be released. Personally, I feel that it's really hard when you want to make the audience to feel as if they are in the story. This show nailed it! </p>

              <p>As you know, Ufotable studio created this piece of art. This is probably the anime with the best animation in the history of anime. From Fate/zero to the other series, all the components mix together really well. Especially about the fight scenes. The progressments and developments from the characters are so relatable and fantastic!</p>

              <p>Review:</p>
              <p>When talking about Korean Dramas, there are a lot of options to take upon to. And this might be the best K-drama ever! I don't want to give the spoilers, so please just check it out and binge-watch it in 16 episodes! Not only the story, but also the characters and genre are amazing. The main characters are played by Son Yejin and Hyun Bin which are very compatible with the male main lead!</p>

              <p>Sometimes, you want to chill and relax. Well, this drama is very healing and relaxing for you to watch. It wonderfully potrays a slice of life within a unique environment. It's about how a dentist who moves to a village where she finds unusual people there, where she grows to love the chief of the village. Shin Min Ah (the actress) is very beautiful and is the best choice for this type of drama! There is also Kim Seonho with a phenomenal acting!</p>

              <p>One of my friends recommend this drama to me. At first I'm not really interested in watching it. But, when I saw the trailer I was hooked. Talking about first episodes, it's really hard to give off such a great first impression; therefore this drama probably has the best first episode in history? Since the first episode, the story keeps on getting great with the love-comedy-thriller vibes. The OSTs are just very wonderful too!</p>

              <p>Review:</p>
              <p>One word for IU, fabulous. Hotel Del Luna is about an owner of a hotel for the dead. It is a mixed of joy and sadness. After decades, finally it's time to change the 'human' manager into someone else. This is the part where the male lead comes in place. It really is just magnificent and very romantic how these two people eventually fall head over heels.</p>

              <p>Snowdrop is one of a kind. It give you off a disney quality drama with a great chemistry between actors! This only came out recently and it makes it into the top dramas ever. The cinematography from the sets and behind the scenes is really just mind blowing. All of the love, hatred, and sadness, is really just tough for all of the viewers. </p>

              <p>I must say that I didn't really expect this show to be good since I don't play LoL. But, THIS SHOW IS SO GOOD! A very interesting universe of characters which already have good backgrounds! I mean this is probably the best show coming out in 2021. The animation and voice acting are just out of this world.</p>

              <p>Review:</p>
              <p> This is the first Spanish TV series I've ever watched. This show has been on my mind for the longest time because I believe that this takes a 'robbery' themed show to another level. The minds behind this story is so extravagant! The creative minds behind this work are truly wonderful.</p>

              <p>Review:</p>
              <p>This show is one of Netflix's most popular and best series. I can understand that. So it's basically about these kids finding themselves in a dangerous world (the upsidedown) when one of their friends is missing. Just can't wait for the 4th season!</p>

              <p>OThis show represents the lives of nobilities, in spesificm the Bridgertons. It really takes you to a kingdom in which these people live, and how they found love in many situations. The narrative will make you wowed and the love story between the main casts are just cute!</p>
